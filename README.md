# stradl_infl-reward

A repository with datasets and R scripts for the project titled '"Feeling Run Down": Links Between Inflammation and Reward Processing in Depression', completed by Arish Mudra Rakshasa (Wellcome Trust PhD in Translational Neuroscience, University of Edinburgh) in collaboration with the Depression Research Group at the University of Edinburgh (Project Lead: Dr. Heather C. Whalley).

This repository contains anonymised demographic, clinical, behavioural, and neuroimaging data from STRADL, a community-based sample of participants, which is a subset of Generation Scotland. Participant information in any replication efforts should be treated with respect and in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) 2016/679.

This repository also contains R scripts for: loading and processing datasets for analysis; power analysis; calculating descriptive statistics for participants; generalised linear models (UKB_lme_reg.R serves as a source script for GLMs that should not be edited) for CGT and fMRI data, including exploratory analyses with interactions; plots of behavioural and neuroimaging data. These scripts source the datasets included in the repository (as named) for analysis.
